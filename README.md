# 🧠 Code Explainer App (GenAI Project using Gemini API)

This is a Generative AI (GenAI) project that uses **Google's Gemini 2.0** Large Language Model (LLM) to explain Python code step-by-step and generate its output. Built with Streamlit, the app provides an interactive and educational experience for developers, students, and educators.

## 🤖 About the Project

This project leverages **Generative AI** to transform how Python code is understood. By inputting any Python snippet, users receive:
- A **human-readable explanation** of each part of the code.
- The **predicted output** of the code execution.

The app is powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 via the `google.generativeai` SDK, integrating the strength of LLMs with a simple web interface.
